# CovarianceDenoising
This project implements the covariance matrix denoising process provided in Marcos M. López de Prado's "Machine Learning for Asset Managers" (2020), Section 2, and visualizes the results in a similar fashion as in the text. However, instead of using simulated data, I fetch data for a portfolio of 30 companies using the yfinance API. 

The portfolio of companies presented in the visualize_denoising.py file represents a random sample of companies, and is not meant as an investment recommendation. This project is meant purely for expository purposes.
